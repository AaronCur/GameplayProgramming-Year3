##Lab 6

###1 Cannon ball 
A ball moving under gravity only.  When you press space, the ball is given an initial force and flies across the screen and lands on the ground.

###2 Cannon
Draw a simple cannon near the bottom left of the sketch (a rectangle will do or you can use an image), so .  
Draw a red dot at the center of base of the cannon (around which you will rotate).  
Hint: to do this you need to use translate to translate to the right point.    

###3 Angle controls  
By pressing up and down arrows you can increase and decrease the angle the cannon points so that it can be pointed in any direction from directly to the right to directly up (Hint: use rotate) 

###4 Power controls 
By pressing left and right arrows you can increase and decrease the power - represent this with a number e.g. 0 to 100 or with a powerbar (a rectangle)

###5 Target
Make a target appear on screen in a random position (ensure it is a good position e.g. not half off the screen or right beside the cannon)
If the target is hit, it should disappear

###6 Bonus
Turn this into a fun game
