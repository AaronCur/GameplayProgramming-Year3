##Lab 9
###1 Read
Read through chapter 5 upto 5.7 (NatureofCode) carefully following along - make sure by the end you are confident you can do the following: 
Distinguish between body, shape, and fixture
Create a body
Transform from world units to pixels
Compare/contrast the steps involved in using physics from scratch with using box2d
Explain the difference between dynamic, static, and kinematic?
When is Box2D a good option to use?
…

Note: You will need to import the pbox2d library:
Sketch|Import library|Add Library…

###2 Exercise 5.2
Download the starter kit from theNatureofCode
It is very very important not to look at solutions for this but to work through this by yourself as this will give you the fundamentals of Box2D (If you rob yourself of this learning experience by looking up solutions you will find yourself very lost when you try to do anything different).

###3 Thomas was Alone 1
Recreate Thomas was Alone 1 (Lab 7) using Box2D.
